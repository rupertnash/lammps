fix wall/diffusive command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID wall/diffusive face arg ... keyword value ... :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
wall/diffusive = style name of this fix command :l
one or more face/arg pairs may be appended, exactly as for the "fix
wall/reflect"_fix_wall_reflect.html command :l
some keyword/value pairs may be appended, some are optional :l
keyword = {walltemp} :l
  REQUIRED: {walltemp} value = number like 273.15 (temperature units)
  REQUIRED: {TMAC} value = number (Tangential momentum accommodation coefficient, dimensionless probability)
  REQUIRED: {seed} value = integer >= 1 to seed pseudorandom number generation
keyword = {units} :l
  OPTIONAL: {units} value = {lattice} or {box}
    {lattice} = the wall position is defined in lattice units
    {box} = the wall position is defined in simulation box units :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

fix xwalls all wall/diffusive xlo EDGE xhi EDGE
fix walls all wall/diffusive xlo 0.0 ylo 10.0 units box
fix top all wall/diffusive zhi v_pressdown :pre

[Description:]

Bound the simulation with one or more walls which diffusively reflect
particles in the specified group when they attempt to move thru them. This is based upon "fix wall/reflect"_fix_wall_reflect.html .

Atoms reflect diffusively (based on the wall_temp supplied) with
probability TMAC and specularly with probability 1-TMAC. All the
provisos of "fix wall/reflect"_fix_wall_reflect.html apply here. You
must specify a seed for the random number generation.

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.  None of the "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html options
are relevant to this fix.  No global or per-atom quantities are stored
by this fix for access by various "output commands"_Howto_output.html.
No parameter of this fix can be used with the {start/stop} keywords of
the "run"_run.html command.  This fix is not invoked during "energy
minimization"_minimize.html.

[Restrictions:]

Any dimension (xyz) that has a reflecting wall must be non-periodic.

A reflecting wall should not be used with rigid bodies such as those
defined by a "fix rigid" command.  This is because the wall/reflect
displaces atoms directly rather than exerts a force on them.  For
rigid bodies, use a soft wall instead, such as "fix
wall/lj93"_fix_wall.html.  LAMMPS will flag the use of a rigid
fix with fix wall/reflect with a warning, but will not generate an
error.
